# European Day-Ahead Load Forecasting
This repository contains code to produce day-ahead electricity demand forecasts on several levels (bottom-, mid- and top-levels) of the european electricity grid.

The methodology was evaluated using open-source data available at https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017175 and is transferable to other load data sets.
[NeuralProphet](https://neuralprophet.com) is used as the time-series forecasting baseline model. A detailed comparison with state-of-the-art benchmark models is conducted on the top-level.
